## About

A mobile Android application that enables efficient and straightforward data backups powered by [Restic](https://restic.net) backup software.

The application uses a custom-built [PRoot](https://codeberg.org/dawdyd/build-proot-android) environment (based on the [build-proot-android](https://github.com/green-green-avk/build-proot-android) project) to run native [Restic](https://restic.net) and [Rclone](https://rclone.org) binaries directly on Android devices.

### Disclaimer
This is an **unofficial** application and is not developed or endorsed by the official Restic project team.

## Key Capabilities
- Repository Management: Create and configure Restic repositories (supports S3, B2, Rest, Local, and Rclone protocols)
- Snapshot Control: Browse and manage your backup snapshots
- Folder Selection: Choose which directories to include in backups
- Automated Scheduling: Set up recurring backup tasks
- Retention Policies: Define cleanup rules for individual folders
- Live Progress: Monitor backup operations through system notifications
- Rclone Integration: Access 40+ cloud storage providers via Rclone backend
- Webhook Notifications: Monitor backup status via HTTP webhooks (supports Gatus, and more) ([docs](docs/webhook.md))
